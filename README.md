# waterMark_app

This is an application I created using an idea from the 100 days of Python Udemy course.
I created this application using Tkinter and PIL. This application allows you to choose an image and then create a text logo choosing placement, color, and opacity. After your text logo is complete you can review it and then exit and save the image.
<h2>Concepts Practiced:</h2>
<li>Use grid() to Complete the User Interface
<li>Dialog Boxes in Tkinter
<li>Selecting Files to Watermark
<li> PIL to composite to images together
